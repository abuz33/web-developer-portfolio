In this simple application using 3rd party API, I have created an application to keep track of corona (or mostly known as COVID-19) disease. The API used in this application is `https://covid19.mathdro.id/api`.

In the application there is an overall information. How many known person got effected of the disease or how many person died due to COVID or How many people was recovered. All of the information is shown using a ChartJs graph. And there is alson another table which shows same information of each of the country which can be selected using the the dropdown.
